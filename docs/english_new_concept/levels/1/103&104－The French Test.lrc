[00:01.47]Lesson 103
[00:04.30]The French test
[00:06.87]Listen to the tape then answer this question.
[00:12.62]How long did the exam last?
[00:17.62]How was the exam, Richard?
[00:20.12]Not too bad. I think I passed in English and Mathematics.
[00:25.03]The questions were very easy. How about you, Gary?
[00:30.82]The English and Maths papers weren't easy enough for me.
[00:34.92]I hope I haven't failed.
[00:38.06]I think I failed the French paper.
[00:40.88]I could answer sixteen of the questions.
[00:43.44]They were very easy.
[00:45.40]But I couldn't answer the rest. They were too difficult for me.
[00:50.70]French tests are awful, aren't they?
[00:53.53]I hate them. I'm sure I've got a low mark.
[00:57.74]Oh, cheer up! Perhaps we didn't do too badly.
[01:01.96]The guy next to me wrote his name at the top of the paper.
[01:05.94]Yes?
[01:07.20]Then he sat there and looked at it for three hours!
[01:11.19]He didn't write a word!
